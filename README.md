In the heart of the Whispering Woods, where acorns and berries were the usual feast, there lived a peculiar little squirrel named Pete. But Pete wasn’t like the other squirrels—while they loved munching on nuts and seeds, Pete had a strange and wonderful obsession… pineapples!

No one knew how it started. Some say he once saw a lost picnic basket filled with tropical fruits. Others claim he had a dream of golden, spiky treasures. But one thing was certain: Pete would do anything for a bite of sweet, juicy pineapple.

The only problem? Pineapples didn’t grow in the forest.
